1. Install mongoDB on your computer. There are tons of guides on how to do this.
2. Open a terminal
3. Write:
		mongod
4. Do not close the terminal, because if you do it will stop the database connection. "mognod" starts the deamon that manages the db.
5. Open another tab/windows of the terminal and type:
		mongo
This is the client that is used to do stuff on the db. There are tons of commands. I will write some of them under this tutorial.

Commands:
In the tab where you typed "mongod" you DO NOT run any commands.
In the tab where you typed "mongo" you can run those and many more commands:
	1. show dbs 				-> shows all databases 
	2. show collections 			-> shows all collections(tables) in the current db
	3. use dbName				-> used to select a db
	4. db.collectionName.find()		-> used to show all documents(entries) in collectionName
	5. use admin;db.shutdownServer()	-> used to stop the mongod instance.
	6. db.collectionName.drop()		-> drops current collection



If this error pops up :
	ERROR: dbpath (/data/db) does not exist.Create this directory or give existing directory in --dbpath.
open a new terminal and type:
	1. sudo mkdir -p /data/db
	2. sudo chown your_username /data/db

If there is any other error try running both:
1. sudo service mongod stop
2. mongod --repair
