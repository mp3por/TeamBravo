The aim of this project is to develop a dashboard website (and/or a mobile app) that visualises the important topics and conversations in Glasgow using data from Twitter. The project involves monitoring tweets posted in Glasgow, and using big data mining and analytics tools (e.g. MapReduce, Mallet) to identify the interesting topics being discussed on Twitter (e.g. top hashtags, most retweeted tweets) and other useful information (e.g. number of users using such hashtags, locations of thetweets, sentiments) in a given time period. It will also involve developing suitable interface(s) that will enable users to have a quick grasp of the information you have collected and processed. In terms of software, your team will need to develop a backend database to store the tweets as they arrive, develop techniques to analyse the data and identify the most interesting insights, and develop suitable user interface(s) to visualise for end-users.
