</br><br><h1>Terrier Future Features and Known Issues</h1>
<p>List of features and known issues that are marked for future Terrier versions:<br/>
<h2>Future Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Consider the use of Maven to build and package Terrier</li>
<li>The addition of Terrier's own Exceptions for setup, indexing, querying.</li>
</ul> 
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>CompressionFactory/CompressionConfig is not supported by single-pass or Hadoop indexing.</li>
<li>Query language should be refined: In particular, ambiguity warnings when generating the parser with ANTLR should be removed, and a more structured query language should be introduced.</li>
<li>The real-time index structures do not currently support block indexing</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deprecations, Scheduled Refactorings</h2>
<p>The following classes and interfaces are/may be deprecated in this version of Terrier and will likely be removed or refactored in a future release:</p>
<ul>
<li>BlockLexiconEntry & BlockFieldLexiconEntry will be removed in a future version of Terrier</li>
<li><a href="javadoc/org/terrier/utility/ApplicationSetup.html">ApplicationSetup</a> will be replaced with a new non-global configuration API.</li>
<li>The five field weighting model score() methods are being deprecated since only the two field versions are used.
<li>Terrier currently uses Hadoop version 0.20. Future releases of Terrier will upgrade to a later branch. Instructions to upgrade Terrier yourself can be found <a href="http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/wiki/Terrier/UpgradingHadoop">here</a></li> 
</ul>
