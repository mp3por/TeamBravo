<p>Provides classes representing single postings and atreams of postings in a posting list 
(e.g. an inverted index or a direct index). </p>
<p>A single posting (e.g. occurrences of a term in document) is represented
by a <a href="Posting.html">Posting</a> object.
<pre>
Posting p;
System.out.println("Docid "+ p.getId() + " has " + p.getFrequency() + " occurrences");
</pre>

<p>A stream of postings (e.g. terms in a document or occurrences of a term) are
represented by an <a href="IterablePosting.html">IterablePosting</a> stream.</p>
<pre>
IterablePosting ip = //obtain from InvertedIndex;
while(ip.next() != IterablePosting.EOL)
{
  System.err.println("Docid "+ ip.getId() + " has " + ip.getFrequency() + " occurrences");
}
</pre>

<p>More complex posting implementations are supported by other Posting child interfaces:
<ul>
<li><a href="Posting.html">Posting</a> - basic posting: id, frequency and document length only.</li>
<li><a href="BlockPosting.html">BlockPosting</a> - positions of occurrences are available.</li>
<li><a href="FieldPosting.html">FieldPosting</a> - the frequencies in each field, as well as field lengths are available.</li>
</ul>
In all cases during retrieval, IterablePosting implementations which also implement Posting, BlockPosting and/or FieldPosting are used, depending on how indexing has been performed. To see how to configure indexing, see <a href="../../../../../configure_indexing.html">Configure Indexing</a>.
