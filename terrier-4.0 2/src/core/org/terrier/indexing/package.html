<p>Provides classes and interfaces related to the indexing of documents.
There are three main abstract concepts that are related to the code
of this package.</p>
<p>The first is the concept of a <a href="Collection.html">Collection</a> of documents. This can be 
a standard TREC test collection, or a connection to a database from 
where the documents are extracted.</p>

<p>The second abstraction is the concept of a <a href="Document.html">Document</a>. An implementation 
of a collection should iterate through the documents in the collection 
and return one at a time. The document encapsulates the parser required
to extract the information to index. Implementations of documents are
provided for TREC documents, PDF documents and standard Microsoft Office
formats, such as MS Word, MS Powerpoint and MS Excel.</p>

<p>The third abstraction is related to the <a href="Indexer.html">Indexer</a>, the process that 
iterates through the documents of a collection and creates the 
necessary data structures. There are several implemented indexers:
<ul>
<li><a href="BasicIndexer.html">BasicIndexer</a> - indexes a Collection without recording position information.
A <a href="../structures/DirectIndex.html">DirectIndex</a> is also built.</li>
<li><a href="BlockIndexer.html">BlockIndexer</a> - as BasicIndexer, but also records position information.</li>
<li><a href="BasicSinglePassIndexer.html">BasicSinglePassIndexer</a> - creates an index without building a DirectIndex. This is approach is inherently more scalable than BasicIndexer.</li>
<li><a href="BlockSinglePassIndexer.html">BlockSinglePassIndexer</a> - as BasicSinglePassIndexer, but also records position information.</li>
<li><a href="hadoop/Hadoop_BasicSinglePassIndexer.html">Hadoop_BasicSinglePassIndexer</a> - a distributed singlepass indexer that makes use of a <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop</a> MapReduce cluster.</li> 
<li><a href="hadoop/Hadoop_BlockSinglePassIndexer.html">Hadoop_BasicSinglePassIndexer</a> - as Hadoop_BasicSinglePassIndexer, but also records position information.</li>
</ul>
