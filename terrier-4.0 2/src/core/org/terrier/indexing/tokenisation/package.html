<p>Provides classes related to the tokenisation of documents. Tokenisers
are responsible for breaking chunks of text into words to be indexed.
Different tokenisers may be used for different languages. In particular,
two tokenisers are provided by Terrier:
<ul>
<li><a href="EnglishTokeniser.html">EnglishTokeniser</a> - splits words on containing characters
not in [A-Za-z0-9].</li> 
<li><a href="UTFTokeniser.html">UTFTokeniser</a> - splits words on containing characters
that are not one of the following:
<ol>
 <li>Character.isLetterOrDigit() returns true</li>
 <li>Character.getType() returns Character.NON_SPACING_MARK</li>
 <li>Character.getType() returns Character.COMBINING_SPACING_MARK</li> 
</ol>
</li>
</ul>

In addition, both default Tokenisers apply rules such as:
<ul>
<li>Removing punctuation</li>
<li>Lowercasing all terms if the property <tt>lowercase</tt> is set (default to true).</li>
<li>Tokens longer than max.term.length are dropped.</li>
<li>Any term which has more than 4 digits is discarded.</li>
<li>Any term which has more than 3 consecutive identical characters are discarded.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Example Code</b><br>
<pre>
//get the default tokeniser, as set by property <tt>tokeniser</tt>
Tokeniser tokeniser = Tokeniser.getTokeniser();
String sentence = "This is a sentence.";
TokenStream toks = tokeniser.tokenise(new StringReader(sentence));
while(toks.hasNext())
{
  String token = toks.next();
}
