/**
 * This class implements the Js_KLs weighting model, which is the product 
 * of two measures: the Jefrreys' divergence with the Kullback Leibler's divergence.
 * The two measures are obtained by the addition of one query token. Then Jefrreys'
 * divergence and the information growth in the document by Kullback Leibler's 
 * divergence are computed. The model computes the product of these two information
 *  measures as amount of information carried by a single query token.
 * Js_KLs is an unsupervised model (parameter free model) of IR. 
 * <p>
 * Js_KLs has a high 
 * performance but it can be used with verbose queries. In particular, it has 
 * statistically or moderately significant better MAP performance than most of the
 * supervised models with long queries on the terabyte collection (GOV2) with the 
 * exception of PL2.
 * MAP for long topics, and comparative p values (two-tailed paired t-test) 
 * compared to supervised models (with optimal MAP parameter values) are as follows:
 * <table BORDER="1" WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="3" CELLSPACING="0">
 * <thead><tr CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td>Queries</td><td>MAP of JS_KLs</td><td>LGD</td><td>Dirichlet_LM</td><td>PL2</td><td>BM25</td><td>In_expB2</td></tr></thead>
 * <tr><td>long</td><td>0.3178</td> <td>(&gt;) p=1.7E-17</td><td>(&gt;) p=0.0544</td><td>(&lt;) p=0.3155</td><td>(&gt;) p=0.7866</td><td>(&gt;) p=5151</td></tr>
