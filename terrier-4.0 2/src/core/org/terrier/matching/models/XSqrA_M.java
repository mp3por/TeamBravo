/**
 * This class implements the XSqrA_M weighting model, which computed the 
 * inner product of Pearson's X^2 with the information growth computed 
 * with the multinomial M.
 * It is an unsupervised DFR model of IR (free from parameters), which 
 * can be used on short or medium verbose queries. 
 * <p> XSqrA_M has a high
 * performance, and in particular has statistically significant better 
 * MAP performance than all other supervised models on the GOV2 collection.
 * MAP for short (title only) and medium (title+description)
 * topics, and comparative p values (two-tailed paired t-test) compared 
 * to supervised models (with optimal MAP parameter values) are as follows:
 * <table BORDER="1" WIDTH="100%" CELLPADDING="3" CELLSPACING="0">
 * <thead><tr CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td>Queries</td><td>MAP of XSqrA_M</td><td>LGD</td><td>Dirichlet_LM</td><td>PL2</td><td>BM25</td><td>In_expB2</td></tr></thead>
