/** Interface for reading a bit compressed file in a random access manner.
 * Each method returns a {@link org.terrier.compression.bit.BitIn} implementation
 * that allows access to the encoded integers. Several implementations exist:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.terrier.compression.bit.BitFileBuffered} - buffers an amount of data starting that the specified offset.</li>
 * <li>{@link org.terrier.compression.bit.BitFile} - buffers the pre-specified amount starting and ending as specified. This implementation can also be used for reading. This class is deprecated.</li> 
 * <li>{@link org.terrier.compression.bit.BitFileInMemory} - reads the entire file into memory. File must be less than Integer.MAX_VALUE (2GB).</li>
 * <li>{@link org.terrier.compression.bit.BitFileInMemoryLarge} - reads the entire file into memory. File size only constrained by available memory.</li>
 * </ul>
