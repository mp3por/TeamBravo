There is a very cool file Git-Windows.docs that i wrote a few weeks ago for another project that explains Git and its basics. Please read it to gain general knowledge on how stuff is done with Git ... :)

I will post here more advanced work flows with Git in order to help me and you in the future.

git branch -a : displays all branches (remotes and local)
git branch -l : displays all LOCAL branches
git branch -r : displays all REMOTE branches

git remote show origin : displays information about the current origin
git ls-remote : displays a detailed list of the remote branches and tags available
